 Apologies for the confusion. Here's a more detailed explanation for the GitHub README and how to install and run the financial fraud detection system:

### Financial Fraud Detection System

This project sets up a financial fraud detection system using Python. It leverages pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

#### Installation
1. **Python Installation:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website.
2. **Library Installation:** Install necessary libraries using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
   ```

#### Usage
1. **Project Setup:** Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and create a new folder for the project. Download all project-related files and save them in this folder.
2. **Run Streamlit Server:** Open a new terminal within the project folder in VSCode. Start the Streamlit server by running the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run frontend.py
   ```
3. **Access the Application:** Once the server starts without errors, it will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501). Access this URL in your web browser.
4. **Interact with the Application:** You should now see the frontend of the financial fraud detection system. Interact with the application as intended by inputting data or using any features provided.
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the system with different inputs to ensure it functions correctly and accurately detects fraudulent activities.
